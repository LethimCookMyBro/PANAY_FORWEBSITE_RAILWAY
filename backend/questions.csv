1,What is the main advantage of PLCnext?,"The main advantage is its openness and flexibility, allowing engineers to use the best programming language for the task, combine existing code, and integrate open-source software, which significantly speeds up application development."
2,Cannot warm start PLC with AXC F 3152,The issue is likely caused by the Start/Stop switch position. Check that the switch is set to 'Start' position (not 'Stop'). The hardware device HMI is preventing the PLC from starting due to the switch configuration.
3,What is the firmware version compatibility for AXC F 3152?,The AXC F 3152 is compatible with firmware version 2025.0.3 (25.0.3.103) when using hardware version 3.
4,How to resolve Arp.Plc.Domain.Plc.Condition.Failed error?,"To resolve this error: 1) Check the physical Start/Stop switch on the PLC unit, 2) Ensure the switch is in 'Start' position (not 'Stop'), 3) The switch position must match the software configuration, 4) If switch is correct, check HMI device configuration."
5,How can I send data from a PLCnext device to InfluxDB?,"To send data from PLCnext to InfluxDB, use the InfluxDB line protocol format and send HTTP POST requests to the write endpoint of your InfluxDB instance (e.g. http://<ip>:8086/write?db=mydb). Ensure proper headers and payload formatting. You can use Python libraries like 'requests' to send data from PLCnext Linux environment."
6,Why can't I warm start my AXC F 3152 PLC?,The Start/Stop switch on the PLC might be set to 'Stop'. Ensure the switch is in 'Start' position. The error message indicates that the hardware device HMI prevents startup due to the switch state.
