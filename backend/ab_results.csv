These ports serve as end points for exchanging data with other components, such as program instances and I/O systems.

Data exchange for IN ports and OUT ports occurs at the beginning and end of each task execution cycle. This ensures that data is stable and consistent during execution. Additionally, a data exchange is only implemented if the program instances are coupled via IN and OUT ports.

The Global Data Space (GDS) acts as a central point for storing all exchanged data. All data is stored centrally in the GDS, ensuring seamless processing during data exchange between user programs, fieldbus systems, and system programs.

In order to establish communication relationships between different programs, the program variables to be exchanged or process data of the I/O components are defined as IN or OUT ports. This enables data exchange between program instances that have been instantiated in different tasks.

For example, Figure 2-22 'Example: Port communication with task 1 and task 2 buffer storage units' demonstrates the behavior of task 1 and task 2, showcasing system balancing and multicore system support.

3.  Update GDS Variables: Programs can update GDS variables directly without going through the Global Data Space. This approach ensures that each task always uses consistent values.
