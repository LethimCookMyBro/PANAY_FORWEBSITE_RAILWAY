  "answer": "Based on the image, your PLC has an MRESET (Memory Reset) switch which is the primary method for factory reset:\n\n**Method 1: Using MRESET Switch (Recommended)**\n1. Turn selector switch to STOP position and wait 5-10 seconds\n2. Turn switch to MRESET position and hold for 5-10 seconds until LEDs flash\n3. Return switch to STOP position\n4. Power cycle: turn off PLC, wait 10 seconds, turn back on\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:** Factory reset will DELETE ALL data including:\n- User programs\n- Retain variables\n- IP configuration\n- Passwords\n- All settings\n\n**BACKUP your project first!**\n\n**Method 2: PLCnext Engineer Software**\n1. Open PLCnext Engineer and connect to PLC\n2. Right-click on device → Select 'Reset to Factory Settings' or 'Format User Partition'\n3. Confirm and wait for completion\n\n**Method 3: Network Configuration Reset**\nVia SSH/Console: `dcp reset` (Note: This typically resets ONLY network settings, not full factory reset)\n\nAfter reset, you'll need to reload your program, reconfigure IP addresses, reset passwords, and reconfigure I/O modules.",
